.SH NAME
pdfresurrect \- tool for extracting versioning data from PDF documents
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pdfresurrect
.RI " file.pdf " [-w] [-q] [-i]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B pdfresurrect
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invoke bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBpdfresurrect\fP is a tool for extracting versioning data from PDF documents.
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-w
Write the PDF versions and summary to disk.
.TP
.B \-q
Display only the number of versions contained in the PDF.
.TP
.B \-i
Display the creator information from the specified PDF.
.SH NOTES
The scrubbing feature (\-s) should not be trusted for any serious security
uses.  After using this feature, please verify that it in fact zero'd all
of the objects that were of concern.
.PP
This tool relies on the application reading the pdfresurrect extracted versions
to treat the last xref(cross-reference) table as the most recent in the
document.  This should typically be the case.
.PP
The verbose output, which tries to deduce the PDF object type (e.g. stream,
page), is not always accurate, and the object counts might not be 100%
accurate.  However, this should not prevent the extraction of the versions.
This output is merely to provide a hint for the user as to what might be
different between the documents.
.PP
Object counts might appear off in linearized PDF documents.  That is not truly
the case, the reason for this is that each version of the PDF consists of the
objects that compose the linear portion of the PDF plus all of the objects that
compose the version in question.  Suppose there is a linearized PDF with 59
objects in its linear portion, and suppose the PDF has a second version that
consists of 21 objects.  The total number of objects in "version 2"
would be 59 + 21 or 80 objects.
